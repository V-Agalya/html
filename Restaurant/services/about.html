    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>No dreamer is ever too small, no dream ever too big. ASK Restaurant has come a long way.There are older restaurants and places with cooler backstories maybe, but for nearly 20 plus years, everyone in Chennai and beyond, young and old, is familiar with ‘ASK Restaurant’. The early days were tougher times, but Ask persons single-handedly made ‘Empire’ possible and together with his family he ran the business with grit and fervour.

     Exotic food like biryani and chickens were served, and also affordable price. They consistently built rapport, making each interaction with customers unique; such was their passion, a sure winner all the way</p>
